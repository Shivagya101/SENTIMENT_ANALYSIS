## SENTIMENT_ANALYSIS
This project implements sentiment analysis using two popular methods: VADER (Valence Aware Dictionary and sEntiment Reasoner) and RoBERTa (Robustly Optimized BERT Pretraining Approach). It analyzes the sentiment of textual data, such as customer reviews or social media posts, and classifies the sentiment into three categories: positive, neutral, and negative.

## Overview
## VADER Sentiment Analysis: 
A lexicon-based method that works well for short and informal text, such as tweets or online reviews. VADER is fast and efficient, making it ideal for processing large datasets with simple text.

## RoBERTa Sentiment Analysis:
A transformer-based model that improves upon BERT. RoBERTa takes into account the context of each word in the text, making it more robust and accurate for understanding complex sentiments and subtleties, like sarcasm.

## Project Features:
Sentiment analysis using VADER and RoBERTa.
Visualization of sentiment scores (positive, neutral, negative) for better understanding.
A comparison of the results produced by the two models on the same dataset.
